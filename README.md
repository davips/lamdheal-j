lamdheal-j
==========

Lamdheal language interpreter and compiler for JVM.

Lamdheal is an easy functional language.
Focused on ease of learning and clear syntax, it is intended to be an agile JVM language and also a shell prompt scripting language. 
The project first target is to finish a production quality interpreter;
the second one is to write a compiler to generate Java code and/or JVM bytecodes; and
the third goal is to compile indirectly to machine code via C code (without Java interaction support, of course).
